  <h1>The worlds simplest spec for financial transactions</h1>
  <p>
    Payments and finance are today governed by lots of different incompatible complex legacy standards developed over the last 40 years. These standards make it hard to interoperate and innovate in the financial space.

<p>
  OpenTransact aims to create the equivalent of the HTTP standard for financial transactions. It is based on established well known HTTP, REST and OAUTH standards. You can use the same standard and implementation code to handle everything from currency payments to loan issuance and stock trades.

<div class="span5">
<pre><code>http://pay.test/usd?<span title="Amount to pay" class="param">amount=10.00</span>&<span title="Payee account" class="param">to=you@example.com</span>&<span title="Optional description" class="param">note=Milk</span>&<span title="Where to redirect to after authorization is made." class="param">redirect_uri=http://site.com/callback</span>&<span title="OAuth 2 client id" class="param">client_id=1234</span></code></pre>
<p>
  If user authorizes it payment is not performed immediately, rather an OAuth token is issued to you which allows you to charge when ready.

</div>

  <div class="span6">
<pre><code>POST <span title="Each financial service (asset) has a unique url." class="param">/transactions/usd</span> HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <span title="OAuth Token is linked to Payers account" class="param">ad180jjd733klru7</span>

<p>
  OAuth token is either authorized using a regular OAuth authorization request or through a Transfer Authorization.
